## Python Part 2

**1. List, Set, and String Operations**
- Len 
  * The len method will return the sum of the total items in an object. on a string, this function will return the number of characters
 - Min and Max
  * The min and max functions are to find out what the minimum and maximum values are.
- Count
  * The count function is to find out how many times an object appears in the list
- Sort
  * The sort() method sorts the list ascending by default. This function can also be used by specifying sorting criteria, such as key and reverse
- Coancatenation
  * Concatenation means joining strings together end-toend to create a new string use the + operator 
- Replication
  * Replication is multiplication operator (*). When used with one string and one integer, * is the string will repeating a single string however many times the given integer
- Range
  * he range() function returns a series of numbers with a certain pattern, to loop (e.g. for) accessing list elements, you can use the range() function in Python
- In and Not In
  * Operators in and not in: To find out a value or object is in a list. This
function will return a boolean value True or False
- Assign values to multiple variables
  * We can assign values to multiple variables at once from a list or tuple element without needing to mark them one by one

**2. Operator, Operands, and Expressions**
- Arithmetic Operators
  * (+) Addition 
  (-) Substraction
  (*) Multiplication
  (/) Divide
  (%) Modulus
  (**) Exponent
  (//) Floor Division
 - Boolean AND, OR
  The 'and' keyword is a logical operator and is used to combine conditional statements, both conditions must be fullfilled
  The 'OR' keyword is used in a boolean expression to check that there is at least one true, if just one side is true the entire expression is true
 - Assignment Operator
  * (=) Equal
  * (+=) Add and Assign 
  * (-+) Substract AND
  * (*=) Multiply AND
  * (/=) Divide AND
  * (%=) Modulus AND
  * (**=) Exponent AND
  * (//= ) Floor Division
 - Precedence Operator
  * Python will always evaluate the arithmetic operators first (** is highest, then multiplication/ division, then addition/subtraction)

**3. Conditional Expression**
 - if
  * Only a statement is True will be executed, if it is False it will not, in Python, the body of the if the indentation indicates statement, the body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end
 - else
  * The if..else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of if only when the test condition is True, if it is False it will not. 'else' is optional
 - elif (else if)
  * If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on, if it is False the body of else is executed. Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition In other words, we can say that elif is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"
  
**4. Loop**
 - For Loops
  * For loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)
 - Nested Loops
  * Nested loop is a loop inside a loop, the "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop"
 - While Loop
  * The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement 
 - Loop Control Statement
  * Break, The Break Statement is a loop control statement that is used to terminate the loop
  * Continue, The continue statement is used when we want to skip a particular condition and continue the rest execution
  * The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When it's executed, nothing happen, but you avoid getting an error
  
**5. List Comprehension**  
 - List Comprehension is a way to generate new list based on pre existing list or iterables
 
**6. Handlin Error**
 - Syntax Error
  * Syntax errors occur when Python can't understand what we mean
 - Exceptions
  * Errors that occur while the process in in progres are called exceptions and can be fatal if not handled
